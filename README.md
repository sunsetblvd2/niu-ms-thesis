Code that I used to collect data for my MS thesis at NIU. Defended in 2023.
This code implements a Monte Carlo simulation measuring the root mean square error (RMSE) of positioning estimates for two algorithms. Sensors are distributed uniformly on a grid where isotropic emitters are present. Sensors collect randomized RF energy measurements at a configurable time interval which are discretized and processed by each algorithm. Each algorithm then provides a positioning estimate based on the discretized data. This process is carried out N times where N is the number of Monte Carlo iterations. The root mean square error is then calculated from the data set produced from the N iterations. Simulation parameters can be swept to produce curves showing the RMSE as a function of a configurable parameter, for example, Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), number of sensors present, or emitter power.

This code was used to produce data which showed the trade-offs for each algorithm under different scenarios, for example, single emitter, multi-emitter, and moving emitter scenarios. This tool could be used by defense, aerospace, or wireless communications companies looking to evaluate different implementations of geopositioning algorithms using RF data measured from wireless sensor networks.
