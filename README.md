Code that I used to collect data for my MS thesis at NIU. Defended in 2023.
This code implements a Monte Carlo simulation measuring the root mean square error (RMSE) of positioning estimates for two algorithms. Sensors are distributed uniformly on a grid where isotropic emitters are present. Sensors collect randomized RF energy measurements at a configurable time interval which is discretized and processed by each algorithm. Each algorithm then provides a positioning estimate based on the discretized data. This process is carried out N times where N is the number of Monte Carlo iterations. The root mean square error is then calculated from the data set produced from the N iterations. Simulation parameters can be swept to produce curves showing the RMSE as a function of a configurable parameter, for example, Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), number of sensors present, or emitter power.
